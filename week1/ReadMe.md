# HelloWorld Contract

## Overview

The `HelloWorld` contract is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It allows the owner of the contract to set a text string, which can be retrieved by anyone.

## Contract Details

### State Variables

- `text`: A private string that stores the text set by the owner of the contract.
- `owner`: A public address that stores the owner of the contract.

### Constructor

The constructor sets the `text` state variable to "Hello World" and the `owner` state variable to the address that deployed the contract.

### Functions

- `helloWorld()`: This function returns the current text. It is a `public` function and can be called by anyone.

- `setText(string calldata newText)`: This function sets the `text` state variable to `newText`. It can only be called by the owner of the contract.

- `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: This function transfers the ownership of the contract to `newOwner`. It can only be called by the current owner.

### Modifiers

- `onlyOwner`: This modifier restricts the `setText` and `transferOwnership` functions to be called only by the owner of the contract. If the caller is not the owner, it reverts the transaction with the message "Caller is not the owner".

## Contract Code

    }

        owner = newOwner;

# Storage Details Report

The following report describes the changes in storage that occurred during the execution of a transaction on the Ethereum address `0xCFC9f4...64B27477`.

## Ether Balances and Nonce

The Ether balance of the address did not change during the transaction. It remained at `0 Eth`. The nonce of the address also remained the same, at `1`, indicating that no new transactions were sent from this address.

## Storage Changes

Four storage slots were updated during the transaction:

1. **Storage Address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:** The initial value was empty. After the transaction, it was updated with the string "Hello World".

2. **Storage Address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001:** The initial value was `0x0`. After the transaction, it was updated with the value `0x1c042700057891c76d2c95b66bb09c441c5ebd2f`, which represents an Ethereum address.

3. **Storage Address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002:** The initial value was `0`. After the transaction, it was updated with the value `1`.

4. **Storage Address 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5ace:** The initial value was `0x0`. After the transaction, it was updated with the value `0x1c042700057891c76d2c95b66bb09c441c5ebd2f`, which represents an Ethereum address.

## Conclusion

The transaction resulted in the update of four storage slots. These changes likely represent the initialization of a smart contract, with the storage slots being used to store the contract's state. The Ethereum address `0x1c042700057891c76d2c95b66bb09c441c5ebd2f` is likely the owner of the contract, and the string "Hello World" is likely an initial state or message of the contract.
